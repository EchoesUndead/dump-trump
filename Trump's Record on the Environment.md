EPA Revokes California’s Authority to Set Climate-Protective Vehicle Emissions Standards: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken final action to revoke California’s authority to set its own vehicle emissions standards that are more climate-protective than federal requirements.  In 2013 EPA granted California a preemption waiver under the Clean Air Act for for its Advanced Clean Car (ACC) regulations, whih include California’s low emission vehicle program, greenhouse gas standards, and zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) program. Today’s action withdraws the preemption waiver for California’s greenhouse gas standards and the ZEV mandate.
